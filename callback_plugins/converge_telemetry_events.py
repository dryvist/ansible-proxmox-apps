Split from converge_telemetry.py, which now holds only the callback lifecycle.
These are ordinary functions over plain dicts with no Ansible callback state,
so they are the half worth reading (and testing) on its own when the question
is "what does a converge publish", not "when does it publish".

Not a callback plugin itself: Ansible's loader only instantiates modules that
are enabled by name, so a sibling here is never loaded as one.
