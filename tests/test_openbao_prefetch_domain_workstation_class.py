"""Every openbao_secrets prefetch-loop domain needs a workstation CIDR class.

roles/openbao_secrets/tasks/fetch_domain.yml logs into one AppRole per
`openbao_secrets_domains` entry (roles/openbao_secrets/defaults/main.yml) --
observability, local-cloud, monitoring, media, apps, ntfy, local-llm -- for
every workstation-run converge (`scripts/run-ansible.sh` from a dev shell).
None of them had a CIDR class override, so all seven defaulted to `machine`
and rejected the workstation exactly like slack-ops did (Vikunja 3098):
observability is first in the loop, so every workstation converge died on the
very first domain, regardless of which app the converge was actually for.

This pins each declared domain to an override whose class includes
`workstation` (bare `workstation` or `machine_or_workstation`), so a domain
added to the prefetch loop without a matching override fails this test
instead of silently 403ing the next workstation converge that reaches it.
