"""Provisioning writes must be sent to the Raft leader, not to whichever node
happens to be the bootstrap host.

Raft accepts a write only on the active node. A standby is expected to forward
it, and that standby->leader hop is the one that intermittently fails in this
estate: the client sees "cannot write to readonly storage" on a write and
"internal error" on an AppRole login. The ingress already avoids the hop by
probing /v1/sys/health WITHOUT standbyok, which evicts every standby from the
pool -- but the converge never traversed the ingress. It ran `bao` against
BAO_ADDR = openbao_api_addr, this node's OWN listener, and
openbao_bootstrap_host is the alphabetically-first group member, picked for
determinism and not for leadership. So every policy/AppRole/engine/KV write in
the converge went over exactly the hop the ingress exists to bypass, for as
long as the leader was any node but the first.

Two things are asserted:

  1. The real openbao_write_addr expression out of init/02 resolves to the
     leader when the cluster reports one, and degrades to this node's own
     listener when it does not -- so a status read that fails or comes back
     leaderless leaves the pre-fix behaviour rather than breaking the converge.

  2. No task on the bootstrap host's provisioning path still pins BAO_ADDR to
     openbao_api_addr. init/01 and init/02 are the deliberate exceptions: they
     probe and initialize THIS node, before a leader is guaranteed to exist.

The expression is rendered out of the task file rather than retyped -- a
retyped template performs its own escaping and can pass while the real one
fails.
