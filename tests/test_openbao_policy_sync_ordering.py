"""Ordering contract for the reconcile-mode policy-sync pair in the openbao
role's init sequence.

A reconcile-mode login only carries the `policy-sync` policy when it is the
inert `openbao-policy-sync` AppRole, and only THAT identity may rewrite the
live `openbao-reconcile` policy from the declared set (see
tasks/init/02-initialize-cluster.yml and
templates/openbao-reconcile-policy.hcl.j2). Every other init step that
consumes a reconcile grant for a NEWLY declared name -- SSH signing roles
(init/07) and AppRoles (init/10) -- 403s against a live reconcile policy that
predates that name, because the write it needs is exactly what policy-sync
was about to grant. Running the sync AFTER those consumers (it used to live
in init/08, run via tasks/init/08-rbac-policies.yml) is a chicken-and-egg: the
403 aborts the play before the sync ever gets a chance to run.

This test parses the REAL task files (init.yml's own include order, plus
each included file's own task list) rather than reimplementing the ordering,
and asserts the sync pair comes before every reconcile-grant consumer it
could otherwise starve.
