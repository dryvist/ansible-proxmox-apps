# hermes_agent

Deploys the **[NousResearch Hermes Agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent)**
— the self-improving **autonomous agent** — headless in a dedicated LXC on the AI
VLAN.

> This is **not** the `ollama` / `open_webui` (`hermes-infer` / `hermes-chat`) LLM
> *serving* stack. Those serve the Hermes-4 *model*; this role runs the *agent*,
> which uses that model (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) as its brain.

## What it does

- Installs Hermes Agent system-wide via the official installer (bundles Python/uv +
  Node), once, behind a `creates` guard. The installer is fetched from the pinned
  release tag's raw URL and **sha256-verified before it runs** — never
  `curl <url> | bash` of a moving remote script — and `--branch <tag>` pins the
  app checkout to the same release. The Hermes daemon owns subsequent updates
  (`hermes update`) — Ansible owns only the platform, so converge stays idempotent.
- Runs the `hermes gateway` daemon under a dedicated non-root `hermes` user via
  systemd. The gateway drives the built-in **cron** scheduler and the **Kanban**
  dispatcher (autonomy) even with no messaging platform configured.
- `HERMES_HOME` (`/var/lib/hermes/.hermes`) lives on a dedicated ZFS data volume —
  memory, skills, profiles, the Kanban DB, sessions and logs — so it is snapshotted
  and replicated to the DR node (the agent's accumulated knowledge is irreplaceable).
- Points the model backend at the LiteLLM router (`Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B` via
  `llm.<subdomain>/v1`, OpenAI-compatible, 262144 context); sets memory provider to **Hindsight** (best self-hostable
  June 2026) alongside the always-on `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md`; caps `agent.max_turns`
  so a runaway loop can't pin the GPU overnight.
- Wires the Slack gateway (Socket Mode) via five env vars in `.env`, read
  directly by Hermes' own Slack adapter — no `config.yaml` changes needed.
  All five default to empty, so the gateway simply runs Slack-free until they
  are set.
- Seeds a daily cron job that summarizes the homelab AI fabric status and posts
  it to the Slack home channel; activation happens on the next converge.

## Installation

This role ships in the `ansible-proxmox-apps` repository — no separate
installation. The role itself fetches and sha256-verifies the pinned Hermes
installer on the target, so the LXC only needs base connectivity and apt.

## Usage

Run the role against its inventory group:

```bash
doppler run -- uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml \
  --tags hermes_agent
```

## Key variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_home` | `/var/lib/hermes` | data-volume mount = the user home |
| `hermes_agent_model_base_url` | `https://llm.{{ PROXMOX_SUBDOMAIN }}/v1` (router) | the brain endpoint |
| `hermes_agent_model` | `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B` | model id (LiteLLM router alias) |
| `hermes_agent_memory_provider` | `hindsight` | external memory provider |
| `hermes_agent_max_turns` | `90` | agentic-loop budget |
| `hermes_agent_slack_bot_token` | `""` | Slack bot OAuth token (`xoxb-…`) |
| `hermes_agent_slack_app_token` | `""` | Slack app-level token for Socket Mode (`xapp-…`) |
| `hermes_agent_slack_allowed_users` | `""` | comma-sep Slack member IDs allowed to DM the bot |
| `hermes_agent_slack_home_channel` | `""` | Slack channel ID for proactive posts |
| `hermes_agent_slack_home_channel_name` | `""` | Slack channel display name |

## Group / invocation

Targets `hermes_agent_group`, derived from the `hermes-agent` tag in `load_tofu.yml`.
Run via `site.yml` (`--tags hermes_agent`).

## Not yet live-validated

Verify on the first converge: (a) `install.sh` runs clean non-interactively as root
on a minimal Debian LXC; (b) `hermes gateway run --replace` stays up headless with no
messaging platform; (c) Hindsight initialises from `config.yaml` alone (it may need
its client package on first run — `memory status` check is non-fatal so it surfaces
without failing the converge). Single-profile first; profiles + Kanban teams + a
messaging gateway are a documented follow-up (the whole `HERMES_HOME` is already
persisted for them).

## LLM knowledge base (llm-wiki)

Enables the bundled `research/llm-wiki` skill so Hermes builds and maintains an
interlinked Markdown "second brain" from raw sources (build / query / lint /
maintain, with SHA256 source-drift detection). The wiki lives at `WIKI_PATH` =
`{{ hermes_agent_wiki_path }}` (`/var/lib/hermes/wiki`) — under the persistent
ZFS volume, so it is snapshotted and replicated. A nightly cron seeds a
lint/health-check. Context compression is enabled (`summary_model` pointed at the
router, since the upstream Google default is unreachable here) so long autonomous
sessions don't overflow.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_wiki_enabled` | `true` | enable llm-wiki + create the wiki dir |
| `hermes_agent_wiki_path` | `{{ hermes_agent_home }}/wiki` | persistent wiki root (`WIKI_PATH`) |
| `hermes_agent_context_compression_enabled` | `true` | auto-shrink long sessions |
| `hermes_agent_context_compression_threshold` | `0.85` | compress at 85% of context |
| `hermes_agent_nightly_wiki_cron_*` | — | nightly lint/health-check cron |

## Autonomous GitHub docs-contributor

Gives Hermes a **read public dryvist repos + open signed, draft, no-merge doc PRs**
capability against `dryvist/docs` and `dryvist/docs-starlight`, via a dedicated
GitHub App (`hermes-docs-bot`). Commits are authored through the
`createCommitOnBranch` GraphQL mutation so GitHub marks them **Verified/signed**
(a plain `git push` is rejected by the org's required-signatures ruleset). The
bundled `dryvist/docs-pr` skill enforces the guardrails: draft-only, attribution
triad, dated branches, `docs:` Conventional-Commit titles, per-repo/day caps +
de-dup, secret redaction, and absolute privacy routing (sensitive → docs-starlight
only). **No-merge** is guaranteed by the org ruleset (human review + signatures,
the App is not a bypass actor), not by the token scope.

App creds are delivered from OpenBao `secret/ai/hermes` (`bao_local_llm_secrets`)
with an env fallback; the PEM is written to `{{ hermes_agent_hermes_home }}/github-app.pem`
(`0600`, `no_log`). The role stays inert until the creds are set.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_github_app_id` | `""` | GitHub App ID (bao/env) |
| `hermes_agent_github_app_installation_id` | `""` | App installation ID (bao/env) |
| `hermes_agent_github_app_private_key` | `""` | App PEM (bao/env; written to a 0600 file) |

Helper unit tests live with the skill in
[nix-hermes](https://github.com/dryvist/nix-hermes)
(`data/skills/dryvist/docs-pr/tests/`) — run `python -m pytest` from that
skill dir (all guardrail logic, no network).

## Content bundle (nix-hermes)

The dryvist skills (docs-pr, github-issues, zammad-incidents, splunk-monitor)
and `SOUL.md` are CONTENT owned by the
[nix-hermes](https://github.com/dryvist/nix-hermes) flake, pinned here by
`hermes_agent_bundle_flake_ref` (a release tag). The converge builds that ref
on the **controller** (`nix build`, guarded by a Layer-1 assert) and
byte-copies the result into `$HERMES_HOME` — the guest never needs nix.
`SOUL.md` is composed at build time from `ai-assistant-instructions`'
`autonomous-base.md` plus the Hermes variant, so no vendored copy can drift.
Renovate bumps the pin on each nix-hermes release; edit skills/persona there,
never in this role.

## GitHub issues & projects

Delivers a fine-grained PAT (`GH_PAT_WRITE_PROJECT_ISSUES`) into `.env` giving
Hermes **read/write Issues across all repos** and **read/write Projects (v2) in
the `dryvist` org** — for triaging, creating and updating issues and managing
project boards. It is deliberately least-privilege: **not** for code commits (that
is the signed `docs-pr` / GitHub App path) and **not** for merges. Bao-first
(`secret/ai/hermes`, `bao_local_llm_secrets`) with an env fallback; empty until the
token is set. The bundled `dryvist/github-issues` skill documents the REST (issues)
and GraphQL (Projects v2) calls and the usage guardrails.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_github_issues_pat` | `""` | issues + org-projects PAT (bao/env) |

## Splunk search access

Registers the **Splunk MCP Server** (Splunkbase 7931, deployed by `ansible-splunk`)
as an HTTP MCP server in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (`mcp_servers.splunk`), so Hermes
can query the environment — `run_splunk_query`, `get_indexes`, `get_sourcetypes` —
with its own scoped identity. The URL and Bearer token are referenced as
`${SPLUNK_MCP_URL}` / `${SPLUNK_MCP_TOKEN}` and resolved from `.env` at connect
time, so neither the endpoint nor the token ever lands in `config.yaml`.

Creds come from the shared OpenBao `secret/ai/mcp/splunk` path (merged into
`bao_local_llm_secrets`) with an env fallback. `ansible-splunk` publishes the
existing shared Splunk service identity as `SPLUNK_MCP_URL` and
`SPLUNK_MCP_TOKEN`. The
`mcp_servers.splunk` entry is omitted until the URL is set, so the agent starts
cleanly before the creds exist.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_mcp_enabled` | `true` | Register the Splunk MCP server |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_mcp_url` | `""` | Splunk MCP Server endpoint (bao/env) |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_mcp_token` | `""` | Bearer token (bao/env) |

## Splunk monitoring (self-directed 24/7 analyst)

On top of raw search access, the role turns Hermes into a **self-directed SIEM
analyst**. It deploys the `dryvist/splunk-monitor` skill and seeds a small fleet
of cron jobs that carry it. The skill encodes two things that sit together:

- **Hard query-safety rails** — every search must be bounded (`tstats` / `stats` /
  `head N ≤ 100`, an explicit narrow time window, project only needed fields). This
  is what stops an unbounded search from flooding the agent's context and crashing
  the run. The rails are non-negotiable.
- **Free direction** — *what* to look for is Hermes' call. The skill teaches an
  investigative method (recall known baselines → orient → hunt → confirm → record →
  decide delivery) and offers lenses, not a checklist. Hermes learns the
  environment over time and invents its own angles.

Each cron job runs in a **fresh, isolated agent session**, so context never builds
up run to run. Anomaly jobs stay silent when nothing is wrong: a run that ends in
the `[SILENT]` marker suppresses delivery entirely, so a normal sweep costs zero
notifications. Findings are written to memory (baselines + open issues, for
dedup), and durable knowledge is captured as `llm-wiki` pages (RAG).

**Routing:** anomaly alerts DM the operator (`slack:<member-id>`); the routine
digest posts to the Slack home channel. The quiet deep-dive research run saves
locally only (`--deliver local`).

**Fresh posts, not one thread.** Each cron run is an isolated session, so its Slack
output is delivered **flat/top-level** (a new message each time) rather than threaded
under a single ever-growing root. This is set in `config.yaml`'s `platforms.slack`
block via `reply_in_thread: false` + `cron_continuable_surface: in_channel`
(`hermes_agent_slack_reply_in_thread` / `hermes_agent_slack_cron_continuable_surface`),
rendered only when Slack is configured.

| Job | Schedule (staggered) | Delivery | Posture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `splunk-triage` | `3,18,33,48 * * * *` | DM, silent-unless-anomaly | broad anomaly hunt |
| `splunk-security` | `9,39 * * * *` | DM, silent-unless-anomaly | security lens |
| `splunk-parsing` | `24 * * * *` | DM, silent-unless-anomaly | data-quality / parsing lens |
| `splunk-deepdive` | `44 */6 * * *` | local (quiet) | characterize one index → wiki + memory |
| `splunk-digest` | `50 * * * *` | home channel (always) | hourly "what I'm seeing + current normal" heartbeat |

Cron seeding is idempotent (create-if-absent) and gated on Hermes being able to
**both** query Splunk (`hermes_agent_splunk_mcp_url` set) **and** deliver to Slack
(bot + app tokens + home channel set) — a job that can't do both is never created.
When Hermes finds a signal worth watching continuously it may register its own
`splunk-auto-*` check and surfaces it in the next digest.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_monitor_enabled` | `true` | Deploy the skill + seed the cron fleet |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_*_cron_name` / `_schedule` / `_prompt` | — | per-job overrides |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_alert_deliver` | `slack:<member-id>` | DM target for anomaly alerts |
| `hermes_agent_splunk_digest_deliver` | `slack` | home-channel target for the digest |

## Inbound job-submission API (sanctioned non-exec path)

The upstream `api_server` gateway platform, enabled when
`hermes_agent_api_server_key` is present (bao-first, `secret/ai/hermes`
`HERMES_API_SERVER_KEY`). It is the **sanctioned way to submit work to the
agent without touching the guest** — no `pct exec`, no SSH-in-and-run:

- `POST /v1/runs` — enqueue an agent run (`{"input": "<prompt>"}`),
  returns `202` + `run_id`; poll `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}` (or stream
  `/v1/runs/{run_id}/events`).
- `/api/jobs` — full cron-job CRUD (create/pause/resume/run), the REST
  equivalent of `hermes cron …`.
- `GET /health` — unauthenticated liveness (everything else requires
  `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; upstream refuses to start the platform
  keyless).

Traefik fronts it as `https://hermes-api.<subdomain>` (tofu ingress row;
port DRY from `service_ports.hermes_api`); the guest firewall scopes the
port to internal sources. Distinct from the webhook receiver below: webhooks
are pre-declared event triggers, this is arbitrary job submission. The
post-converge gate probes `/health` and asserts a keyless `POST /v1/runs`
is refused with 401.

Concurrency is capped (`hermes_agent_api_max_concurrent_runs`, rendered as
`gateway.api_server.max_concurrent_runs`): the brain is one shared serving
deployment the cron fleet already uses, so over-cap submissions get
`429 + Retry-After` at the door instead of stacking prefills on the GPU.
Upstream already provides per-run `cancelled` state and `POST
/v1/runs/{run_id}/stop`; idempotency keys and a priority queue on `/v1/runs`
are upstream feature gaps tracked as a build-out issue, not role config.

## Curriculum (graded five-job eval, versioned)

`files/curriculum/` is the versioned home of the graded curriculum — the
repeatable job set that measures whether the agent is actually useful and
feeds the escalation rubric with datapoints. Deployed to
`$HERMES_HOME/curriculum/` on every converge.

| Artifact | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `curriculum.yml` | Canonical manifest: order, budgets, expected skills, and each job's **machine-checkable `success_checks`** |
| `jobs/*.md` | The five prompts, submitted verbatim as `POST /v1/runs` input |
| `grading-sheet.md` | Four 0-3 dimensions per job + verified-claim spot checks + the cross-job omissions check |
| `escalation-rubric-schema.md` | The feature schema (F1-F8) the graded runs populate to fit deep-vs-broad tier routing |
| `submission-runbook.md` | Turnkey submission: preflight gates, key fetch, staggered submits, collection, grading |

The jobs: `orient` (verified self-orientation), `reposweep` (read-only
GitHub triage), `splunk` (one deep investigation via the bundled
splunk-monitor skill), `apps` (fleet health: log errors cross-referenced
with repo issues; files capped `[hermes-fleet-health]` issues through the
agent's own PAT flow), `improve` (evidence-based self-improvement; files
capped `[hermes-improve]` issues). `success_checks` are evaluated from the
run object, event stream, and GitHub — never the job's own summary.

Layer-1 asserts guarantee the manifest is always executable: unique job ids,
every `prompt_file` present in the role, and a non-empty `success_checks`
list per job. Job ids follow clustered/normal naming (the original
`night-orient` draft id shipped here as `orient`).

## Runner-enforced tool policy (per job class)

A submitted `input` — and everything a job retrieves while running — is
untrusted text that can carry prompt injection. The **runner's toolset
resolution**, not the prompt, decides what each job class may load; injected
instructions cannot widen a toolset list the runner never registered. Policy
is plain data in `defaults/main.yml`:

| Layer | Rendered as | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_disabled_toolsets` | `agent.disabled_toolsets` | Global deny floor; no allowlist can widen past it |
| `hermes_agent_api_server_toolsets` | `platform_toolsets.api_server` | API-submitted runs (untrusted input) |
| `hermes_agent_cron_toolsets` | `platform_toolsets.cron` | The scheduled fleet (upstream also hard-blocks cronjob/messaging/clarify in cron) |

The allowlists deliberately exclude `cronjob` (no injected persistence),
`browser`, `delegation`, and `clarify`; Layer-1 asserts fail the converge if
any of those creep back in or a denied toolset is simultaneously allowlisted.
Enabled MCP servers (splunk/context7/codex) layer onto the allowlists by
upstream's platform-tools semantics. The interactive Slack surface keeps the
upstream default (operator-driven, allowed-users gate) minus the deny floor.

## Brain-health watchdog (no cron-failure spam)

The cron fleet above talks to a **single-deployment brain** (`ai-default`, served
by one Mac Studio via the `llm_router` proxy) with **no viable fallback**. When
that brain is unreachable, two upstream facts combine badly: each cron run is a
**fresh, stateless session**, and upstream *always* delivers a failure —
*"Failed jobs always deliver regardless of the `[SILENT]` marker; only successful
runs can be silenced."* So a brain outage makes every seeded job fail and DM the
operator (twice an hour for `splunk-security` alone), while nothing pages that the
brain is even down — `service_deadman` watches DNS/Traefik/HAProxy/OpenBao, not
the LLM fabric.

This watchdog closes both gaps with a small `systemd` timer
(`hermes-brain-watchdog.timer`, every 60s, run as the `hermes` user):

1. **Probe** `ai-default` end-to-end through the same router URL the crons use — a
   1-token completion, so it catches a connection error *and* a reachable-but-
   wedged brain. It hits the already-active model (no cold-model spawn) and keeps
   it warm, matching the intended 24/7 posture.
2. **Debounce** — declare DOWN only after `down_after` consecutive failures (3 ≈
   3 min) and UP after `up_after` successes (2). This rides brief bounces
   (rotation flips, cold reloads) so the watchdog never becomes a *new* source of
   spam.
3. **On a transition** — `hermes cron pause` (or `resume`) the role-seeded fleet
   (`hermes_agent_seeded_cron_names`; user/agent jobs are never touched) and alert
   **exactly once** per edge to **both** a Slack DM (the operator, same place the
   spam was) and an **urgent ntfy** push (the `keystone` feed other homelab
   outages page on). Paused jobs don't fire, so the outage stops producing spam
   instead of amplifying it.

Pausing loses no coverage a run would otherwise achieve — the brain is down either
way — it just makes the gap visible **once** instead of drowning it in 500s.
Gated on the same Slack tokens that seed the fleet (no fleet → nothing to guard).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_enabled` | `true` | Deploy + start the watchdog timer |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_interval` | `60s` | Probe cadence (`OnUnitActiveSec`) |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_probe_timeout` | `15` | Per-probe curl deadline (seconds) |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_down_after` | `3` | Consecutive fails → pause + alert |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_up_after` | `2` | Consecutive oks → resume + alert |
| `hermes_agent_brain_watchdog_ntfy_topic` | `keystone` | ntfy topic for the urgent page |

## Live docs (Context7)

Registers Context7's hosted HTTP MCP server (`mcp_servers.context7`) so Hermes
can pull **current, version-specific library/framework docs** on demand instead
of relying on stale training data. The API key is referenced as
`${CONTEXT7_API_KEY}` (resolved from `.env`), bao-first (`secret/ai/hermes`) with
env fallback; the entry is omitted until the key is set.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_context7_mcp_enabled` | `true` | Register the Context7 MCP server |
| `hermes_agent_context7_api_key` | `""` | Context7 API key (bao/env) |

## Escalation (Codex via MCP)

Registers `codex mcp-server` (OpenAI's Codex CLI) as an MCP tool
(`mcp_servers.codex`) — a deliberate escalation path for problems worth a
stronger model, or a session that's stuck/looping. This is **not** automatic
on-error fallback (Hermes' own `fallback_providers` feature is intentionally
unused here); tool use is inherently a per-call, model-chosen decision, so
the agent reaches for Codex only when it judges the problem warrants it, the
same way it decides whether to call any other tool.

Codex runs under a completely separate, low-privilege OS user —
`codex-runner`, provisioned by the sibling `codex_runner` role on the same
host — never as `hermes`. The MCP entry invokes it through a single-command
`sudo` grant (`hermes` → `codex-runner`, exactly `codex mcp-server`, nothing
else); Hermes never gains filesystem access to that user's ChatGPT-OAuth
credential, so the token itself is not directly readable by the agent even
though the agent can fully use the tool.

Codex's OAuth login is a manual, one-time, interactive step that cannot be
automated by Ansible — see `roles/codex_runner/README.md` for both bootstrap
options (fresh `codex login`, or copying an already-authenticated
`~/.codex/auth.json`). Until that's done, the MCP entry is present but every
call to it errors; the daemon itself starts and runs normally regardless.

OpenRouter is reachable with **no Hermes-side wiring**: the `llm_router` role
registers OpenRouter models as explicit router aliases (first:
`openrouter-free`), with one OpenBao-held key **per model** under
`secret/ai/saas/openrouter` — Hermes just names the alias like any other
model. The old account-wide `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` parked in `secret/ai/hermes`
is superseded by those per-model keys and should be retired once they are
seeded.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_agent_codex_mcp_enabled` | `true` | Register the Codex MCP server |
